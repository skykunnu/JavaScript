//AJAX--> Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
/*
1. It is a set of web development techniques.
2. It is used to create asynchronous web applications.
3. using Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously(in the background)
without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page. 
4. We don't use data in XML format anymore but we use JSON now. 

# We have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
1. XML HTTP Request (Old way of doing)
2. Fetch API (new way of doing)
3. axios (this is third party library)

//HTTP request--> medium to talk between client and server.
